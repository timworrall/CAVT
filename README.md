This readme file is a companion to the above paper. It describes how to replicate the simulations presented in Figures~1-5 and Tables~2 and~4 of the paper.

The associated files are CAVT1.nb, CAVT2.nb, CAVT1.pdf, CAVT2.pdf, CAVTFigures.nb, glossay.pdf and SupplementaryAppendix.pdf. 

The files can be found at: https://github.com/timworrall/CAVT.

SIMULATIONS

Simulations were done in Mathematica and are compatible with version 12.0.

There are two separate Mathematica notebook files, CAVT1.nb and CAVT2.nb. CAVT1.nb covers the two-state case used in Figures~1-4 and Tables~2 and~4. CAVT2.nb is for the four-state case presented in Figure~5. The corresponding ``PDF'' versions are also available: CAVT1.pdf and CAVT2.pdf.

The files can be run directly. 

Files are annotated to explain notation. Notation follows that of the paper. A letter ``c'' is added to indicate the currency area; a letter ``f'' to denote the flexible exchange rate regime; a ``0'' denotes a variable evaluates with no transfer; and a ''o'' denotes a variable with the optimal transfer.

For examples of the correspondence between the notation used in the Mathematica notebooks and the paper, see the file glossaty.pdf.

FIGURE PRODUCTION

Labels for Figures are produced with MaTeX (see, http://szhorvat.net/mathematica/MaTeX for installation details). Figures can be reproduced from the file CAVTFigures.nb. 

Run the file CAVTFigures.nb after running both CAVT1.nb and CAVT2.nb. 

SUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX

The Supplementary Appendix file SupplementaryAppendix.pdf contains the derivations of equations~(15) and~(16) in the paper.
